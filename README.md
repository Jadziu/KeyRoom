## Scenario:

1. Open application,
2. ~~Check if database created:~~
    - ~~If not ~~ask for making~~, make DB,~~
    - ~~If yes, continue,~~
    - ~~Inform user,~~
3. Read from DB:
    - Inform if is no records,
    - Inform if entry is empty
    - 'SHOW' will display list of URLs
4. Write to DB:
   - Info if doubled, error,
5. Update DB:
   - Ask if sure.
6. Delete from DB
7. - Ask if sure.

## To do:

- GUI (tkinter):
  - ~~Make definition for frame,~~ **NO GO**
- DB (sqllite3):
  - OID, autoincremet ID (to check),
  - ~~OOP connecting and operation,~~
  - Encryption,
- GUI main window ("look"):
    - ~~Image~~
    - Text boxes:
      - ~~Website,~~
      - ~~Login,~~

      - Delate,
      - Update,
   - ~~Color~~
   - Icons as button?,
   - ~~Status bar~~,
   - New window with urls,
- Icon
- Lock geometry

***

## Milestone:

- ~~First GUI~~
- ~~Better GUI~~
- ~~File (DB) Check~~
- ~~Database operation~~
- ~~Write to DB~~
- ~~Read from DB~~
- Make app fully operational
- Encryption
- Easter Eggs
