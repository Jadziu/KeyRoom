## Scenario:

1. Open application,
2. Check if database created:
    - If not ~~ask for making~~, make DB,
    - If yes, continue,
3. Read from DB
4. Write to DB:
   - Info if doubled, error,
5. Update DB:
   - Ask if sure.

## To do:

- GUI (tkinter):
  - ~~Make definition for frame,~~ **NO GO**
- DB (sqllite3):
  - OID, autoincremet ID (to check),
  - OOP connecting and operation,
  - Encryption,
- GUI main window ("look"):
